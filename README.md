Calculator with arithmetic operations and respecting the operations' priority .

The calculator app :

•	Has a number display, which displays either the current input or the result of the desired calculation.
•	App contains screen with desired buttons that adjust calculator display
•	Accordingly.
•	Add, multiply, subtract, divide both positive and negative integers and floats respective to the order of operatons.
•	Have a ‘percent’ button.
•	Have ‘clear’ and ‘all clear’ buttons, combined in one.

Room for improvement :
•	At the moment if number/0 the screen return “Inf” , instead of “error” or a more user friendly message, however the app doesn’t crash on dividing by 0.
•	The calculator doesn’t prevent the user to press an operator more than one time. For instance if the user presses “4++ =” the result will be 8. This issue has been identified and there are plans to improve it on the next release!
